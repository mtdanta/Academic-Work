### Project Abstract (English Summary)

This project provides a comprehensive classification of homographies (projective transformations) in finite-dimensional projective spaces over both the complex ($\mathbb{C}$) and real ($\mathbb{R}$) fields.

The primary objective is to provide a practical classification method by approaching the problem from a linear algebra perspective. The classification is based entirely on the **Jordan Canonical Form** of the matrix $A \in GL(n+1, K)$ associated with the projective transformation.

We analyze the structure of the eigenvalues (and their algebraic vs. geometric multiplicity) to define distinct canonical cases. Each case corresponds to a unique geometric action, which is determined by the structure of its fixed points (the eigenspaces).

### Key Contents

The report includes:

1.  A formal study of the Jordan Canonical Form as the primary tool for classification.
2.  A complete classification of all homographies in the complex projective plane, $\mathbb{P}^{2}(\mathbb{C})$.
3.  A complete classification of all homographies in the complex projective 3-space, $\mathbb{P}^{3}(\mathbb{C})$.
4.  A specific analysis of homologies (a key type of transformation with a hyperplane of fixed points).
5.  The adaptation of this classification for the real projective spaces, $\mathbb{P}^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathbb{P}^{3}(\mathbb{R})$.
