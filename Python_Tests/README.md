# 🐍 Python Explorations & Computational Math

This directory serves as a **sandbox** for my independent study of Python libraries applied to mathematics.

As a mathematics undergraduate, I use this space to bridge the gap between abstract theory and computational visualization. The code here consists of self-guided experiments, "Hello World" tests for complex libraries, and practical implementations of algebraic/topological concepts.

## 🧪 Current Explorations

### 1. Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
**📂 File:** [`TDA_Introduction.ipynb`](./TDA_introduction.ipynb)
**📚 Libraries:** `Gudhi`, `Matplotlib`, `Numpy`.

A first approach to computational topology using the **Gudhi** library.
* **Goal:** To compute and visualize algebraic invariants from point cloud data.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Construction of Simplicial Complexes (Rips Complex).
    * Calculation of Persistent Homology.
    * Visualization of **Persistence Diagrams** and **Barcodes**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
These are the tools I have experimented with in this repository:

| Library | Mathematical Application | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Gudhi](https://gudhi.inria.fr/)** | Algebraic Topology, Persistent Homology | 🟢 Active |
| **NumPy** | Linear Algebra, Matrix Operations | 🟢 Active |
| **Matplotlib** | Data Visualization | 🟢 Active |
| *(Future)* | *SymPy / NetworkX* | *Symbolic Math / Graph Theory* | ⚪ Planned |

## ⚠️ Note on Code Structure
Please note that the scripts in this folder are **exploratory**. They are designed to test features and verify mathematical intuitions, not necessarily to be production-ready software.
