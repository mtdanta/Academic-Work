# Computational Mathematics & Python

This directory serves as a computational laboratory for my independent study. The goal is to bridge the gap between abstract theory and computational visualization, implementing algorithms related to Algebraic Topology and Data Analysis.

## 1. Current Explorations

### ➡️ [Notebook: TDA Introduction](TDA_introduction.ipynb)
* **Focus:** Computational Topology using the **Gudhi** library.
* **Objective:** To compute algebraic invariants from point cloud data and visualize topological features.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  Generation of random point clouds on $S^1$ and other manifolds.
    2.  Construction of Vietoris-Rips complexes.
    3.  Calculation of Persistent Homology groups.
    4.  Visualization via Persistence Diagrams and Barcodes.

## 2. Technical Stack

The following tools are currently being implemented to support mathematical experimentation:

| Library | Mathematical Application | Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Gudhi](https://gudhi.inria.fr/)** | **Algebraic Topology** | Simplicial complexes, Persistent Homology |
| **NumPy** | **Linear Algebra** | Vector spaces, Matrix operations, Data structures |
