## 📝 Detailed Descriptions

### 1. Classification in Projective Geometry
**📂 Location:** [`/Projective-Geometry-Classification`](./Projective-Geometry-Classification/)

* **Focus:** Classification of homographies and homologies in projective spaces ($\mathbb{P}^n$) using **Jordan Canonical Forms**.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Francisco Castro Jiménez.
* **Output:** A research paper (PDF) analyzing the algebraic structure of projective transformations and their geometric implications.

### 2. Advanced Topics in Topology & Group Theory
*(Folder coming soon as materials are formalized)*

* **Focus:** Study of advanced algebraic invariants.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Ramón J. Flores (Dept. of Geometry and Topology).
* **Context:** Ongoing departmental collaboration ("Alumno Interno").
