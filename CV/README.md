# Academic CV Template (LaTeX)

A clean, academic Curriculum Vitae template designed for Mathematics and Science students. This template is optimized for readability using the Palatino font and includes a toggle switch to adapt the layout for different international standards.

## Features

* **Boolean Logic Switch:** Easily toggle between a **European style** (with photo & side column) and an **Anglo-Saxon/International style** (text-only) by changing a single variable: `\setbool{showphoto}{true/false}`.
* **Math Typography:** Uses `mathpazo` and `amssymb` for high-quality mathematical notation (e.g., $\mathbb{R}P^n$).
* **Clean Structure:** Organized with clear sections for Education, Research Experience, and Academic Engagement.
* **Privacy-Ready:** The code provided is a template. Replace the placeholder data with your own information.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository or download the `.tex` file.
2.  Open in your favorite LaTeX editor (Overleaf, TeXShop, VS Code).
3.  **For the Photo Version:**
    * Place a square/portrait image named `photo.jpg` in the same directory.
    * Set `\setbool{showphoto}{true}` in the preamble.
4.  **For the Text Version:**
    * Set `\setbool{showphoto}{false}`.
