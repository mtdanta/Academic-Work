# Mario Torres Danta - Academic Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio. I am a 3rd-year Mathematics undergraduate at the University of Seville (US) with a strong passion for Abstract Algebra and Algebraic Topology.

This repository contains my research projects, CV source code, and independent study explorations.

## 1. Research Projects

This section contains my formal research and departmental collaborations ("Alumno Interno").

### ➡️ [Current] Advanced Topics in Topology & Group Theory
* **Description:** A guided study regarding advanced algebraic invariants, complementing the standard undergraduate curriculum.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Ramón J. Flores.
* **Department:** Geometry and Topology (US).
* *(Work in progress)*

### ➡️ [Project: Projective Geometry Classification](Projective-Geometry-Classification/)
* **Description:** An undergraduate research project on the classification of homographies and homologies in projective spaces using Jordan Canonical Forms.
* **Role:** Co-Author.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Francisco Castro Jiménez.
* *(The folder contains the original Spanish PDF and a detailed English abstract in its README.)*

## 2. CV Template (LaTeX)

This section contains the source code of my Academic CV. It is designed as a reusable template for other students.

### ➡️ [CV Source Code](CV/)
* **Description:** A highly customizable LaTeX academic CV template using the Palatino font.
* **Key Feature:** It includes a **boolean switch** (`\setbool{showphoto}{...}`) in the code to easily toggle between a European layout (with photo & side column) and an International layout (text-only).
* **Format:** `.tex` source code and generated `.pdf` examples.

## 3. Independent Study & Code Explorations

This section contains code related to my self-study interests.

### ➡️ [Python & TDA](Python_Tests/)
* **Description:** A basic self-guided exploration into Topological Data Analysis (TDA) using the `gudhi` library in Python.
* **Notebook:** [`TDA_Introduction.ipynb`](Python_Tests/TDA_introduction.ipynb)
* **Content:** This project calculates and visualizes **persistence diagrams and barcodes from point cloud data.**
* **Content:** This project calculates and visualizes the persistent homology (Betti numbers) of a point cloud sampled from several topological objects.
